          H2Organizer is a straightforward app that allows the user to
          effectively track water and other drink consumption. My focus with
          this project was on Interaction Design. My goals were two-fold: to
          create a highly intuitive design and create interactions that are
          rewarding to the user and promote further use.

          To no surprise, there is a wide variety of water tracker apps in the
          app store. What came as more of a surprise was the lack of good ones.
          I saw overly complicated and thus overwhelming apps. These are
          one-task apps, they should be intuitive and simple. I also saw a lack
          of rewarding visuals and animations; with something so simple there is
          a good opportunity to build polished interactive animations that
          reward the user for using the app.

        I used Times for my home page and Georgia for all of my recipe pages. Since this is a very simple, almost one-task website I didn’t see any need to overwhelm the user with a ton of colors, sticking to one primary green and a grey for the occasional hover state. I let the imagery the client provided do most of the visual heavy lifting.

Overall this project was a success. The first indicator of that was the client’s positive reaction to this project. I managed to design and develop a fully functional recipe website that incorporated the client-provided database and was built to a professional standard. 

This project was also a great personal success. This was my first time using PHP and incorporating SQL databases into my code. I feel that I learned enough to apply this knowledge to all future projects, greatly broadening my skillset in what I can produce. Additionally, I further cemented my skills in HTML, CSS, and JS.
